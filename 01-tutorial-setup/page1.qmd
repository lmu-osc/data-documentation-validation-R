title: "Project Setup"

This section guides you through setting up your R environment for data documentation and validation. You'll create a project using **Quarto**, a tool for creating documents that combine code and text.

## Why Use Quarto?

You might wonder: "I just want to learn about data dictionaries and validation. Why do I need Quarto?"

**Quarto** lets you write documents that mix explanatory text with R code, then automatically generate professional HTML/PDF reports. Your data dictionary and validation results will live in one cohesive document that you can share with collaborators.

**The payoff:** After this one-time setup, you'll be able to generate beautiful, reproducible data documentation with a single click.

## Create Quarto Project

First, we will need to create a new Quarto project.

If you haven't already, open RStudio
-- see @nte-terminal for how to use the terminal instead.
Then, click on _File_ > _New Project..._ to open the _New Project Wizard_.

Here, select _New Directory_

![](images/setup_02.png){width=600px fig-align="center"}

And choose the project type _Quarto Project_.

![](images/setup_03.png){width=600px fig-align="center"}

Finally, enter the name of the directory where our report will be created in,
for example `data-documentation-validation-exercise`.

You can leave _Create a git repository_ and _Use renv with this project_ unchecked to keep things simple for this tutorial.
TODO: Update the screenshots to remove checks for git and renv.

If you are already familiar with Markdown and Quarto,
you can also uncheck the box _Use visual markdown editor_.

Click on _Create Project_.
Your RStudio window should now look similar to this:

![](images/setup_05.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" alt="The project `data-documentation-validation-exercise` opened in RStudio. The source pane to the top left has a Quarto file open called \"data-documentation-validation-exercise.qmd\". The console pane to the bottom left shows the R console. The environment pane to the top right indicates that the environment is currently empty. The output pane to the bottom right shows the files in the current project."}

If, like in the image, a Quarto file with some demo content was opened automatically,
you can close and delete it, for example, using RStudio's file manager.

Throughout this tutorial, you will need to run R code in the _Console_ tab.

### Without RStudio

Without RStudio, you can create a Quarto project by typing the following into a terminal:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto create project default data-documentation-validation-exercise
cd data-documentation-validation-exercise/
rm data-documentation-validation-exercise.qmd
```

Then, open an R session by typing `R` into the terminal.
Make sure that `getwd()` shows your working directory is `data-documentation-validation-exercise`.

## Checkpoint: Verify Your Project Setup

Before moving to the next section, verify your setup is working:

**Check working directory** - Should end with your project name
```{r}
#| eval: false
getwd()
```
Expected output: Path ending in your project folder name (e.g., `data-documentation-validation-exercise`)

If this doesn't show the correct path, review the steps above or ask for help before continuing.

## Next Steps

Your project is now set up with Quarto! In the next section, you'll install the R packages needed for data documentation and get familiar with the Palmer Penguins dataset.
