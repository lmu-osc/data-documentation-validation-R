In this tutorial, we'll work with real research data to learn data documentation principles. You'll also get familiar with the key R packages that make data validation and documentation efficient.

## Our Example Dataset: Palmer Penguins

![Palmer Penguins](../material/images/palmerpenguins.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}
:::

We'll use the **Palmer Penguins dataset** throughout this tutorial - observations of three penguin species collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The dataset includes 344 observations of 8 variables:

- **Numeric measurements**: Bill length, bill depth, flipper length (millimeters), and body mass (grams)
- **Categorical data**: Species, island, sex, and year

This dataset is perfect for learning because it contains different data types, has some missing values (realistic!), is scientifically meaningful, and is small enough to understand completely.

### Two Versions: Clean and Messy

You'll work with **two versions** of this data:

1. **Clean data** (`penguins_clean.csv`): High-quality dataset for learning documentation
2. **Messy data** (`penguins_messy.csv`): Contains 30 intentional data quality problems for practicing validation

The messy version mirrors real-world issues you'll encounter: typos in species/island names, inconsistent formatting (e.g., "M" vs "male"), impossible values (negative measurements, placeholder 999), extreme outliers (body mass of 15,000g when max should be ~6,300g), and data entry errors.

## How We Created the Messy Data

We introduced 30 realistic data quality issues across 344 observations, including:

- **Species**: 4 issues (typos like "Adelei", case errors, extra text like "Gentoo penguin")
- **Island**: 2 issues (typos like "Torgerson", case errors like "biscoe")
- **Bill length**: 3 issues (negative -5.2, impossible 250.5, placeholder 999)
- **Bill depth**: 2 issues (negative -2.1, placeholder 99.9)
- **Flipper length**: 1 issue (zero value)
- **Body mass**: 3 issues (extreme outliers: 15000g, 500g, 10000g)
- **Sex**: 11 issues (inconsistent coding: M/F/male/Male/MALE/m/Female)
- **Year**: 4 issues (2020, 2006, 207, 20009)

These mirror common problems in real research data: data entry mistakes, sensor errors, placeholder values not removed, and transcription errors. The generation script is in [`_scripts/create_messy_data.R`](../_scripts/create_messy_data.R).

## Key R Packages We'll Use

Throughout this tutorial, you'll work with three main packages:

- **`{datawizard}`**: Automates creation of data dictionaries
- **`{pointblank}`**: Performs systematic data validation
- **`{skimr}`**: Generates comprehensive data summaries

## Installing Required Packages

Install the packages you'll need:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install core packages
install.packages(c(
  "datawizard",      # Data dictionaries
  "pointblank",      # Data validation
  "skimr",           # Summary statistics
  "dplyr",           # Data manipulation
  "readr"            # Reading CSV files
))
```

## Download the Datasets

Download both versions of the Palmer Penguins data:

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">
<a href="../data/penguins_clean.csv" download="penguins_clean.csv" class="btn btn-primary" style="margin-right: 10px;">
Download Clean Data
</a>

<a href="../data/penguins_messy.csv" download="penguins_messy.csv" class="btn btn-warning">
Download Messy Data
</a>
</div>

**Important**: Save both files in a folder called `data/` inside your project directory. If the `data/` folder doesn't exist yet, create it first.

## Load and Verify the Data

Now load the clean data and verify it worked:

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(readr)  # fast, consistent functions to read CSV/TSV into tibbles
library(dplyr)  # tidy, readable verbs for data manipulation (filter, select, mutate, summarize) that we'll use later

# Load the clean penguins data
penguins_clean <- read_csv("data/penguins_clean.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Take a first look
glimpse(penguins_clean)
```

## Why readr and dplyr Instead of Base R?

While base R has `read.csv()` and `str()`, we use `readr` and `dplyr` because:

- **`read_csv()`** is more beginner-friendly than `read.csv()`:
  - Doesn't automatically convert text to factors (fewer surprises)
  - Better default column type detection
  - Shows a clear summary of column types
  - Creates tibbles which display more nicely

- **`glimpse()`** is clearer than `str()`:
  - More compact, readable output
  - Shows first few values of each column
  - Better formatting for wide datasets

These packages are part of the widely-used tidyverse ecosystem, so learning them now will help you in future R work. For this tutorial, we use minimal functions from these packages so you can focus on data validation concepts rather than R syntax.

You should see 344 observations of 8 variables.

## Checkpoint: Verify Your Data

Before continuing, verify the data loaded correctly:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Should show 344 rows and 8 columns
dim(penguins_clean)

# Should display: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
#                 flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year
names(penguins_clean)

# Check first few rows
head(penguins_clean)
```

If you see errors:

- Make sure both CSV files are in the `data/` folder
- Check that your working directory is your project folder (use `getwd()` to verify)
- Try restarting R

## Next Steps

You now have your environment set up with the necessary packages and both datasets. In the next section, you'll learn how to create data dictionaries that document what each variable means and how it should be interpreted.
