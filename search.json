    "section": "Creating Your First Automated Dictionary",
    "text": "Creating Your First Automated Dictionary\nLet’s create a codebook for the Palmer Penguins data.\n\nStep 1: Load and Prepare Data\nWe’ll start by loading the clean penguins dataset. Make sure you’ve installed the {datawizard} package as described in the tutorial setup.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(datawizard)\n\n# Load the clean penguins data from CSV\npenguins &lt;- read_csv(\"data/penguins_clean.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate the Codebook\nThe simplest way to create a codebook is to call data_codebook() on your data frame:\n\n# Create the data codebook using datawizard's data_codebook() function\ncodebook_penguins &lt;- data_codebook(penguins)\n\n# View the codebook\nprint(codebook_penguins)\n\nThis single command generates a structured table with:\n\nVariable ID and Name\nData Type (character, numeric, etc.)\nMissing Values (count and percentage)\nValues/Ranges (categories or numeric ranges)\nFrequencies (N and percentages for each category)\n\nThe output is a data frame that can be exported to CSV, Excel, or included in R Markdown/Quarto documents.\n\n\nStep 3: Add Variable Labels\nYou can add descriptive labels to make the codebook more informative. These labels are stored as attributes (extra information attached to each column).\nWhat this code does:\n\nstructure(column, label = \"description\") attaches a label to a column without changing its data\nmutate() replaces each column with a labeled version of itself (same data, just with a description attached)\nThe %&gt;% pipe operator passes the data from one step to the next\n\nImportant: The number of columns stays the same, and the data values don’t change. You’re just adding descriptive information that data_codebook() can extract and display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFor Python Users\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to how pandas allows you to add .attrs to Series or DataFrames. The %&gt;% pipe operator works like method chaining in Python.\n\n\n\n\n# Add variable labels using attributes\npenguins_labeled &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    species = structure(species, label = \"Penguin species observed in Palmer Archipelago\"),\n    island = structure(island, label = \"Island where penguin was observed\"),\n    bill_length_mm = structure(bill_length_mm, label = \"Bill length from tip to base (mm)\"),\n    bill_depth_mm = structure(bill_depth_mm, label = \"Bill depth at base (mm)\"),\n    flipper_length_mm = structure(flipper_length_mm, label = \"Flipper length from body to tip (mm)\"),\n    body_mass_g = structure(body_mass_g, label = \"Body mass measured in field (grams)\"),\n    sex = structure(sex, label = \"Biological sex (male, female, or NA)\"),\n    year = structure(year, label = \"Year of observation (2007-2009)\")\n  )\n\n# Generate codebook with labels\ncodebook_labeled &lt;- data_codebook(penguins_labeled)\nprint(codebook_labeled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow Labels Work\n\n\n\nWhen you add labels with structure(), they’re attached to columns in R’s memory. When you create a codebook with data_codebook(), these labels get extracted and displayed in the output table.\nImportant note: If you save penguins_labeled as a CSV, the labels will be lost (CSV can only store data, not attributes). But the codebook itself preserves the labels as regular text in a “Label” column, so when you export the codebook, everything is saved properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThinking Point\n\n\n\nCompare these labels to your manual dictionary from the previous section. Are they equally informative? What context might be missing? This is why the “automated” approach still requires your careful thought, you’re providing the content, R is just handling the presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheckpoint: Verify Your Codebook\n\n\n\nAfter running the code above, you should have:\n\nA codebook_labeled object in R containing the formatted codebook\nThe codebook displayed in your console with all 8 variables\nLabels visible in the output for each variable\n\nIf you don’t see the labels in the output, check that you ran the penguins_labeled code before generating the codebook.",

(Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)\nContent: Are bill lengths within the documented range? (30-60mm)\nDomain: Are body masses biologically plausible? (2500-6500g)\n\nWhen you run this function on the clean data, all checks pass. When you run it on the messy data, it fails multiple checks and shows you exactly where problems exist.",

Think of it as the “instruction manual” for your data, it tells anyone (including future you) exactly what each column means, how it was measured, and how to interpret the values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipConsider This\n\n\n\nBefore we continue, reflect on your most recent research project. How would a colleague understand your data if you shared it with them today? What questions would they need to ask you?\n\n\n\nEssential Components\nEvery data dictionary should include:\n\nVariable Name: The exact column name in your data file (e.g., bill_length_mm)\nVariable Label: A human-readable name (e.g., “Bill Length”)\n\nDescription: Clear definition of what was measured (e.g., “Length of the penguin’s bill measured in millimeters”)\nData Type: The type of data stored (numeric, character, categorical, date)\nUnits: For numeric variables, the unit of measurement (mm, grams, years)\nValid Values: Expected range or categories (e.g., “0-100” or “male, female”)\nMissing Values: How missing data is coded (NA, -999, blank)",

Is score a percentage (0-100) or raw points (0-50)? Is treatment coded as 1/0 or A/B? These ambiguities lead to analysis errors that can invalidate entire studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReal-World Example\n\n\n\nA research team spent months analyzing survey data where satisfaction was coded 1-5. They treated 5 as “very satisfied.” Only later did they discover that 1 was actually the highest satisfaction score. Their conclusions were completely backwards!\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Collaboration\nWhen a new team member joins your project, a data dictionary gets them productive immediately. They can understand and use your data without hours of explanation or guesswork.\n\n\nMeeting FAIR Principles\nFAIR data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. A quality data dictionary directly supports all four principles by making your data understandable and usable by others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFAIR Data Management Tutorial\n\n\n\nFor more on FAIR principles and research data management concepts, check out our FAIR Data Management Tutorial.",

Here are three common approaches:\n\nSpreadsheet Software (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice)\nBest for: Most research teams, easy sharing and collaboration\nCreate your dictionary table directly in a spreadsheet with columns for each essential component. Save as CSV for better compatibility with R and other analysis software.\nPros: Familiar interface, collaborative editing, easy to share\nCons: Can be tricky to track changes over time\n\n\nMarkdown Tables (in .md or .qmd files)\nBest for: Projects using Quarto or reproducible workflows\nUse plain text tables that render beautifully in Quarto documents. These are great for keeping your documentation in the same file as your analysis code.\nTemplate:\n| Variable Name | Label | Description | Type | Units | Valid Values | Missing |\n|---------------|-------|-------------|------|-------|--------------|---------|\n| variable1     |       |             |      |       |              |         |\n| variable2     |       |             |      |       |              |         |\nPros: Works seamlessly with Quarto, readable as plain text, keeps documentation with code\nCons: Less intuitive for non-technical collaborators\n\n\nWord Processors (Word, Google Docs)\nBest for: Teams preferring familiar document formats\nCreate a simple table with the essential columns, similar to spreadsheets but with more formatting options.\n| Variable Name | Label | Description | Type | Units | Valid Values | Missing |\n|---------------|-------|-------------|------|-------|--------------|---------|\n| species       |       |             |      |       |              |         |\n| bill_length_mm|       |             |      |       |              |         |\n| sex           |       |             |      |       |              |         |\n| year          |       |             |      |       |              |         |\nPros: Rich formatting, familiar to most researchers\nCons: Harder to integrate with R analysis code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation for This Tutorial\n\n\n\nSince you’re learning with Quarto, try creating your data dictionary as a markdown table in a .qmd file.
